    title: "Hello — I'm Travis, an award-winning Perth based digital designer, developer and creative consultant who loves bringing ideas to life.",
    other: "Over the last 20 years, I've built all kinds of digital stuff — from apps for startups and record labels to projects for Google and the UN. My work's been featured by Apple and picked up awards from Cannes, D&AD, Spike, The One Show, AWARD Awards, and the ACS. I've worked with top agencies like VML and Wunderman Thompson, helping brands like Wendy's, KitKat, HBF and Heinz bring their ideas to life.<br /><br />I love stepping into the unknown, knowing that real change often arrives shrouded in misunderstanding. I don't chase titles or jobs. I aim for roles that unite and uplift, always focused on the greater mission. I try to be a person of purpose — the type others turn to when limits need to be redefined. <br /><br />If you're tired of having a dream inside your head that you need to be reality, you've come to the right place.

The experience allows users to click into each excuse that threaten our survival, pictured as asteroids looming above the earth that threaten to do the same. Within each they will find information and tools to provide direct action. The tools include a Chrome Plugin Thesaurus Rex, designed to help people navigated the terms around fossil fuels online, The Voice of Reason, an Alexa skill that disarmingly rebuts every climate change myth or excuse; a spin on The Birds and The Bees with an e-book that gives children the arguments they need to convince their parents and peers. All rolled out by the United Nations in the largest campaign they've ever done."

Back in the early days, I was the go-to tech guy—working on the apps, websites, server stuff, social sharing, event software, all of it. No joke, Smilebooth is still one of the things I'm most proud of being a part of. Total bucket list kind of project. It was a wild ride. The photos you see are just scratching the surface of some of the familiar faces I got to see in the booth, including Jeff Bridges — and for the record, he's probably my all-time favorite actor. So it was pretty cool. But honestly, seeing people like that is pretty normal around a Smilebooth. So many amazing people, brands, and celebrities just naturally gravitate towards it. There is something about Smilebooth that is pure magic."

Inspired by Mike and Callum's passion for cool climate winemaking and the deep relationships they've built over 25 years across Western Australia and Victoria, the brand needed to feel authentic, spirited, and rooted in connection. The name \"Fervor\" captures the energy and love they pour into their craft. The visual identity and packaging reflect the elegance of the Great Southern Region, balanced with a sense of exploration and modern design, setting the tone for a label that feels both classic and vibrant — just like the wines themselves."
