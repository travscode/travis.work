    other: "Over the past two decades, I've built digital experiences for everyone from small start-ups, to record labels, to local businesses, to the United Nations and Google. I've worked on projects of all shapes and sizes. My work has been recognised by The One Show, AWARD Awards, the ACS, and even featured globally by Apple on their App Store. I've been fortunate enough to work with some of the world's top agencies — including VML and Wunderman Thompson — shaping digital experiences for brands like Wendy's, KitKat, Heinz, Synergy, and HBF. Today, I'm focused on building my own thing, continuing to push the boundaries of design, technology, and creativity. <br /><br />If you're interested in working together, feel free to drop me a note by clicking contact above.",

The World of Excuses is a digital eco-system that aims to propel people beyond awareness, and inspire the world to move from apathy to action and help save the planet. The experience allows users to click into each excuse that threaten our survival, pictured as asteroids looming above the earth that threaten to do the same. Within each they will find information and tools to provide direct action. The tools include a Chrome Plugin Thesaurus Rex, designed to help people navigated the terms around fossil fuels online, The Voice of Reason, an Alexa skill that disarmingly rebuts every climate change myth or excuse; a spin on The Birds and The Bees with an e-book that gives children the arguments they need to convince their parents and peers. All being rolled out by the end of 2022."

Inspired by Mike and Callum's passion for cool climate winemaking and the deep relationships they've built over 25 years across Western Australia and Victoria, the brand needed to feel authentic, spirited, and rooted in connection. The name \"Fervor\" captures the energy and love they pour into their craft. The visual identity and packaging reflect the elegance of the Great Southern Region, balanced with a sense of exploration and modern design, setting the tone for a label that feels both classic and vibrant — just like the wines themselves."
