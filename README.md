✨ My Personal Website (Now Open Source)

Hey there! My name is Travis Weerts. I'm a designer / developer / hacker of sorts living in Perth, Western Australia.

I’ve decided to make my personal website fully open source.

Why?
Because I believe in the power of sharing, community, and creativity. I want to help grow a community of designers and developers who care about craft—and aren’t afraid to do things a little differently.

So if you're into clean code, thoughtful design, and building experiences that actually feel good to use—this might be your kinda vibe.

🛠 Built with Next.js
This site is powered by Next.js, with a modern stack focused on performance, accessibility, and vibes.
It’s fast, flexible, and designed to scale beautifully for creative projects.

💡 What’s Inside
✨ Thoughtful layout and styling

🎨 Real-world use of animation, typography, and responsiveness

⚡ A solid foundation for any creative portfolio or indie project

🧩 Easy to remix, extend, or learn from

👐 Steal This Site (Seriously)
Feel free to fork, clone, remix, rebuild, or completely reimagine it.
No strings. Just give credit where it’s due if you ship something publicly 🙏
